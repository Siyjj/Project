<font face="Arial" size= 4><p> When pressing 1 <b style="color:burlywood;"> The Forest King</b> begins to glitch out and fires a similarly glitchy projectile from his face in whatever direction he's looking. When this projectile hits a player, a glitchy static overlay will appear on their screen, making it harder to see and slowly damaging them. The projectile can go through walls. This also cannot kill players.

<p> When pressing 2 <b style="color:burlywood;">The Forest King</b> will summon a transparent head to chase nearby players. When a player gets near one of these heads, a creepy ambience will play on their end, their vision will gain a red tint with the word "him" appearing in multiple places on their screen, and they will become highlighted for <b style="color:burlywood;">The Forest King</b>. Upon touching players, the heads confine them to a glitchy root that limits their movement to only a small area around it. This root vanishes after 4.5 seconds. Up to five heads can exist at once.
