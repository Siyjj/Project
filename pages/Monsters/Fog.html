<p> When pressing 2 <b style="color:maroon;">Fogborn</b> will whistle and stand still for about five seconds. If someone looks at it during this state, it will be struck by lightning, and the player that triggered the ability will be highlighted in red. For the duration of <b>Foggy Stare</b>, multiple things will occur. The <b style="color:maroon;">Fogborn's</b> sprint animation and attack animation will be replaced with a crawling animation and bite respectively, its stamina usage will be reduced, it will become incredibly fast, its M1 speed will become faster, and all players who haven't yet triggered <b>Foggy Stare</b> during that game will be "darkened" for about 3.5 seconds and will be immune to The Fogborn's attacks for the duration of the ability. After nine seconds, the effects of <b>Foggy Stare</b> will end.
<b>Foggy Stare</b> has a cooldown of 16 seconds and will only begin the cooldown once a player has triggered it or it times out. If the latter, The Fogborn will receive 40 stamina in return.
