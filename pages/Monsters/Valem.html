<font face="Arial" size= 4><p> When pressing 1 <b style="color:darkkhaki;">Valem</b> uses this ability, he will float up into the air and turn invisible for 3 seconds, spawning an illusion of himself in the location he used the ability, as well as allowing him to move at high speeds for the duration. The illusions spawned by this ability will play voicelines and face towards nearby survivors, who will be beckoned by these illusions visually along with auditorily. When a survivor is near an illusion it will passively drop items, and give the survivors one of three buffs: 35 HP healed, 1.25x Sprint Speed, or regen stamina TBA. However survivors being near the illusions will be highlighted for <b style="color:darkkhaki;">Valem</b>. Which <b style="color:darkkhaki;">Valem</b> can teleport to at any time by holding E while looking at the illusion of his choice, causing a explosion that deals 30 damage to anyone close enough. 10 Second cooldown, Illusions lasts 32 seconds.
