<p> <b style="color:MidnightBlue;">PCX</b> (formerly known as Sonic.EXE or Pillar X), initially teased May 11th, 2024 and officially added December 22nd, 2024, is the sixteenth monster added to Pillar Chase 2. He is TheBladeNinja's own take on "Sonic.EXE", a demonic version of Sonic the Hedgehog with godlike powers who enjoys tormenting the souls of Sonic's friends as well as toying with whoever plays his game in general. Sonic.EXE is the main antagonist of the creepypasta by the same name which started a trend of many subsequent Sonic creepypastas, EXEs and other general horror works. PCX costs 1666 coins in the shop, being the most expensive monster in the game (as of the Stricken update). He was released during the Christmas 2024 event, making him the last monster to be released during the year of 2024.<br><br><br>
