<font face="Arial" size= 4><p> When pressing 1 <b style="color:MidnightBlue;">Exe</b> will charge forward with an outstretched hand. If he comes in contact with a player, he will grab them for 10 damage, then bite them in the face for an additional 40, dealing 50 damage overall.

<p> When pressing 2 <b style="color:MidnightBlue;">Exe</b> will place a oval of black tendrils on the floor at his exact location. If a player steps on it, they will be trapped and have to hold E 15 times to free themselves from the trap. Other players can also help free the trapped player by holding E repeatedly while near them. When a player is caught in a Thorny Grave, they will be highlighted for the duration, and <b style="color:midnightblue;">EXE</b> will gain a brief speed boost.
The trap will kill the player if they are 5 HP or under. <b style="color:midnightblue;">EXE</b> can place up to 5 traps at a time. Has a 5 second cooldown.
