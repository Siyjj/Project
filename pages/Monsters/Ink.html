<p> <b style="color:Dimgrey;">Inkfell</b> initially teased May 6th, 2024, and officially added October 29th, 2024, is the fifteenth monster in Pillar Chase 2. He is an original form of the Ink Demon (also known as Bendy) from the horror game Bendy and the Ink Machine and its sequel, Bendy and the Dark Revival. He was originally intended to be the original Ink Demon (particularly, his appearance in the second game), but was later given an original design to avoid any potential copyright issues with the development team, Joey Drew Studios Inc. He can be unlocked for 1500 Coins in the shop.<br><br><br>

<font face="Arial" size= 4><p> When pressing 1 <b style="color:Dimgrey;">Inkfell</b> will throw up a massive puddle of ink onto the ground that swirls around. Players who walk through this puddle will be giving the Inked status effect and highlighted for <b style="color:dimgrey;">Inkfell</b>. In addition to this, <b style="color:dimgrey;">Inkfell</b> can hold E on these portals to traverse through them. Exiting a portal has <b style="color:dimgrey;">Inkfell</b> pop out and screech, exploding the portal he teleported out from. This explosion deals 35 damage and applies the Inked effect. <b style="color:dimgrey;">Inkfell</b> will also be boosted by TBA speed when he exits a portal. Max of 6 portals, with a 6 second cooldown on both placing and teleporting through the portals.

<p> When pressing 2 <b style="color:Dimgrey;">Inkfell</b> will slam his hands on the ground and cause a inky explosion around himself. This slows down players, applies the Inked debuff, and deals 35 damage. If <b style="color:dimgrey;">Inkfell</b> does this ability near any portal(s), or if a player is near one, the portal(s) will explode, applying the same effects. This does not delete the portal if you use Devils Rage on it. 15 second cooldown
