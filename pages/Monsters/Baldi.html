<font face="Arial" size= 4><p> <b style="color:limegreen;">Baldi</b> places a notebook down onto his current position with a distinctive <b>"HA HA HAAA!"</b>. If any player touches the notebook, they will get a math equation on their screen as well as a timer. If they answer the equation correctly before time runs out, the round's time decreases and the player will take 5 damage. If the player answers incorrectly or runs out of time, they take 40 damage, and the round's timer increases. Either way, <b style="color:limegreen;">Baldi's</b> speed will increase. Has an 11 second cooldown

<p> <b style="color:limegreen;">Baldi</b> places a tape player onto his current position. The tape will play a loud noise, causing every player around the tape to be highlighted in green. The noise from the tape also muffles <b style="color:limegreen;">Baldi's</b> ruler sound, but not when Baldi uses his M1. Lasts for 15 seconds. Has a 23 second cooldown.
