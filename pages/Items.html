If the player holds down the M1 button, the player will slowly start healing themselves. If the healing is completely done, <br>
the player will regain a large portion of health (exactly 65 health, to be specific), or fully heal themselves, 
<br>depending on the amounts of health lost. This can be incredibly useful since it fixes the bone break effect as well.
<br> Players cannot sprint while healing and their walkspeed will be reduced, Sto

Stephano is the sixth item in-game. it is a rare item and can be found around the map or bought in the shop.<br>
 It resembles a golden statue holding a sword.<br><br>


<font size= "2"> <h2>Utility </h2> </font> <br>

When Stephano is held he allows the player to highlight monsters if they are close to them, <br>
and makes a breathing sound when getting close to a monster. He also plays a sound saying "Helloz, I am Stephano.".
<br> <br>

<font size= "2"> <h2>Trivia</h2> </font><br>
Despite the item coming from the game Amnesia, the item itself references more Pewdiepie, which named the statue Stephano.
<br>
Stephano used to give a 5% speed boost while held, have durability that made it<br>
 that you could hold it for 10 seconds, and could not highlight nearby monsters.

The Doom's Gauntlet (Or Doomfist Gauntlet) is the seventh item in-game that can be either found in the map or being bought,

<font size= "2"><h2>Utility</h2></font> <br>

Upon pressing M1 with the Doom's Gauntlet the player will start charging their fist up before sending out a punch forward.
<br> If the punch hits a monster, the monster will get knocked back extremely fast. The gauntlet goes for around 80 studs, <br>
The Gauntlet can also do an uppercut with M2 (Right Click) wich can block attacks, 
<br>The Gauntlet has 3 uses (3 Uppercuts, 3 Punches or 2 Uppercuts and 1 Punch), and once there are no uses left the item is
<br> dropped on the ground and becomes unusable and cannot be picked up. If dropped by <br>
pressing Q after punching once, the punches will not reset and whoever next picks up the Gauntlet will be left with just 1 punch to work with.

The Weird Mask is the fifth item in-game, it is a rare, incredibly difficult to find item (around 1/65 of chance, being %1,54)<br>
 that can be found where the monster spawned at. It has the appearance of SCP-035.<br> A happy white porcelain comedy mask, with some ink coming out of its eyes.
<font size= 2>
<h2>Utility</h2> </font>
If you are looking for the Zombie page itself, please click here.

When the player clicks the mask while holding it, they will automatically put it onto their face,<br>
 turning them into a zombie that will be able to gain XP and kill other players. <br>
Each attack deals 18 damage to a survivor if it hits, taking 6 hits to kill a normal survivor.<br>
 The Weird Mask is usually used for 2 situations. Either as a way to become a monster early<br>
 because the user is impatient and wants to have a round at monster but doesn't want to spend Robux to<br>
 increase the chances they become one sooner, or immediately put it on if a mask managed to spawn naturally;<br>
 or as a last ditch attempt to avoid getting killed by the round's monster.
