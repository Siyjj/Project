Maps, as the title suggests, are the explorable places that players are teleported to survive in from the Monsters. All of them each having their own objective/s to do. Some are better with specific killers, while some aren't. A perfect example would be EXE, who does well on maps like Fazbear's Fright but does not do well on Forest.
