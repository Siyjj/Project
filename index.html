Pillar Chase 2 is a difficult survival horror game where you survive multiple rounds by either being chased by a Monster or chasing other people as the Monster. <br>
Each Monster has their own unique abilities and playstyle. It is developed by The_BladeNinja and other developers in his team. It is a direct sequel and remaster <br>
of Pillar Chase. Both games are directly inspired by a Halo Reach custom gamemode.
